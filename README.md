# ATM-Basic-Project
Creating an ATM simulation in C language is a common and valuable exercise for learning programming concepts. 
It allows you to practice various aspects of C programming, such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

I have provided this feature in this program.

1.Withdrawal: Let users withdraw money from their account, ensuring they have sufficient funds.
2.Deposit: Allow users to deposit money into their account.
3.Check balance: Allow users to check their account balance.
4.Exit option: Provide a way for users to exit the program when they are done.

You can also add more feature for greater understanding on c language aspects and for practise.

1.User authentication: Allow users to input a PIN or password to access their account.
2.Account creation: Provide an option for users to create a new account with an initial balance.
3.Transaction history: Keep a record of the user's transactions, such as withdrawals and deposits.
4.Error handling: Handle invalid inputs and insufficient balance scenarios gracefully.
